# CRUD-contact-list-jsonplaceholder-api
Created with CodeSandbox
Created a contact list app to manage contacts where I'm :
* Fetching the data and showing users from the api - https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users
* Adding a contact, by making a POST call to the above url and saving the contact in react state. (This is dummy call).
* Updating a contact, make a PUT call to the above url. (Again this is a dummy call).
* Deleting a contact, make a DELETE call to the above url. (Again this is a dummy call)
